# @luan.sh/pi-imagegen

Codex image generation and editing using the standalone
`@howaboua/pi-codex-imagegen` package, pinned to `0.0.4`. The conversion extension is not required.
Sign in to OpenAI Codex in Pi, then ask for an image. The managed harness loads
the tool automatically.

`image_gen__imagegen` accepts `prompt` plus either `referenced_image_paths` or
`num_last_images_to_include` for edits. Omit both selectors for a new image.
Generated files are saved by the upstream package and their paths appear in the
result. Use this tool directly in the managed harness so images reach the model
and the transcript.

Install independently with `pi install ./harnesses/pi/agent/packages/pi-imagegen`.
Do not also load the upstream extension entry point: this package registers its
public tool implementation with our shared renderer.
